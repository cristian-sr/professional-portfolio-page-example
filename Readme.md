# Professional Portfolio Page - Example

Do you want to become a web developer? 

Well, you need a portfolio! 

It’s fairly common to use your GitHub account as a CV of your work, but why don’t we build our own page for it?

That’s what this project is all about, and we’ll be using HTML and CSS to create a personal portfolio page to highlight your various projects and skills. 

What’s really cool about this HTML project is that we'll be using HTML5’s multimedia elements along with advanced CSS techniques to create a clean design that really stands out.

That said, let’s cover the skills you’ll be using:

- HTML5: Create a structured and semantic HTML document.
- Responsive Design: Making sure the portfolio displays nicely on different screen sizes, using media queries to adapt the layout to various devices.
- Multimedia Embeddings: Embed video and audio elements to demonstrate your multimedia capabilities and previous projects.
- CSS Custom Properties: Use CSS variables for consistent styling.
- Form Handling: Using text fields to create a contact form for prospective clients.

The stand-out feature of this project has to be the multimedia elements. This is one of the coolest features of HTML5, and there’s no better time than now to learn how to use them.

We’ve also made sure that these look great on all screen sizes by focusing on a responsive design.

Note that we’ve chosen not to use Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks in this HTML project as it’s a great way to keep the codebase light while also working on your CSS skills.

The goal here is to create a minimalistic portfolio design with a focus on the content rather than heavy graphical elements. 

But like I keep saying, please feel free to change this! Get creative, make changes, make some more, and learn while you’re doing it.

After all, this is supposed to be your portfolio, so make it your own!

You’ll also notice I’ve included an optional CSS styling option for a background image for the header. Try this out, and remember to change the image path to your own.

You could also consider altering the footer section styling. Try it all, and see what you like!

Overall, the HTML and CSS code I’ve included below is a great starting point, but I’d love to see how you take this and run with it.
